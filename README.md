* [x] Game buttons each light up and play a sound when clicked. 
* [x] Computer plays back sequence of clues including sound and visual cue for each button
* [x] Play progresses to the next turn (the user gets the next step in the pattern) after a correct guess.

## Reflection Questions
1. If you used any outside resources to help complete your submission (websites, books, people, etc) list them here. 

- w3schools.com
- rgbcolorcode.com

2. What was a challenge you encountered in creating this submission (be specific)? How did you overcome it? (recommended 200 - 400 words) 

Most of the issues I encountered came from my lack of familiarity with JavaScript and lack of knowledge of how to translate the ideas I know work in Python
to JavaScript. The guess() function was a challenge because I did not know how to write conditional statements in JavaScript, which frustrated me and pushed my
focus away from trying to understand and implement the actual game logic. I had to resort to peeking at the solution just to get started, but once I figured out how
JavaScript worked as compared to Python, I was able to write a bit more of that function on my own. It helped that I was able to look at outside sources to better understand
the language, because it then made coding much more enjoyable, and I was then able to come up with other features I would like to implement, while at the same time
having a clear idea of how exactly to do it. Therefore, looking at the documentation was a huge help in overcoming this challenge.

3. What questions about web development do you have after completing your submission? (recommended 100 - 300 words) 

I am now wondering what it takes to build a more ambitious website. For example, I wonder how I could create multiple pages and make them
so they are all kept together in one file, if there are any other tools besides JavaScript and CSS that help improve a webpage, how long it might
take to create a more complex website from scratch and how many people tend to be involved in the process, what other resources there are besides Glitch
for web development, how some of the coolest-looking websites manage to look the way they do, how ads fit into this framework, etc.

4. If you had a few more hours to work on this project, what would you spend them doing (for example: refactoring certain functions, adding additional features, etc). Be specific. (recommended 100 - 300 words) 

I would read more on the documentation for JavaScript, HTML, and CSS, for example image tags. I would try to really understand how to implement the optional features.
I would also try to see how to translate all the ideas I know in Python to JavaScript, since the latter is key in web development.
